A Visual Studio 2012 extension providing easy access to project debug command line arguments, via a dockable re-sizeable textbox.

## Features ##
- history
- saved command line args, which you can name
- syntax highlighting
- a range of settings; history depth, font family and size, syntax highlighting colours

If you'd like to help with the project, I've listed my future plans at the bottom of CHANGELOG.txt - other ideas are also welcome.
