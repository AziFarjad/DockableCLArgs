A Visual Studio 2012 extension providing easy access to project debug command line arguments, via a dockable re-sizeable textbox.

## Features ##
- history & saved command line args, via right click menu
- syntax highlighting ![](http://i.imgur.com/ganhXVZ.png)
- a range of settings; history depth, font family and size, syntax highlighting colours ![](http://i.imgur.com/di7wk8t.png)
- supports C++, C#, and VB projects (VB support is untested, let me know if there are problems)

## License ##
The project as a whole is under the [MIT license](https://github.com/MatthewCox/DockableCLArgs/blob/master/LICENSE.txt), so do whatever you want with it as long as you include the license and an attribution to me.

The textbox control is [AvalonEdit](https://github.com/icsharpcode/SharpDevelop/wiki/AvalonEdit), which is under the [LGPL](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html).

The colour controls on the settings window are from the [WPF Color Picker Construction Kit](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/131708/WPF-Color-Picker-Construction-Kit), and they're under the [Code Project Open License](http://www.codeproject.com/info/cpol10.aspx).
